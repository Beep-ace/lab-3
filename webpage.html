         Naruto is a fictional character from a series Naruto. Created by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto is one of the anime community's longest-running and most beloved shows. It ran for 300+ episodes when it first debuted but, thanks to a time jump, eventually spanned 500 additional episodes. The show is so beloved that it also spawned a spin-off series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. Naruto, the anime, is based on the manga of the same name, but differs in several ways, with some changes being more successful than others. It's not uncommon for notable anime adaptations to stray from the original manga; they usually incorporate more filler to extend the series for TV. In the case of Naruto, the anime is less bloody (likely to appeal to a broader, younger audience), and adds flashbacks and recaps to lengthen the show, along with several other fundamental differences.
